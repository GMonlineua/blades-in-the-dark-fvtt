You could try to spot a good ambush point (but Hunting might be better).</em>",
      "Sway": "When you <strong>Sway</strong>, you influence someone with guile, charm, or argument. <em>You might lie convincingly. You might persuade someone to do what you want. You might argue a case that leaves no clear rebuttal. You could try to trick people into affection or obedience (but Consorting or Commanding might be better).</em>",
      "Tinker": "When you <strong>Tinker</strong>, you fiddle with devices and mechanisms. <em>You might create a new gadget or alter an existing item. You might pick a lock or crack a safe. You might disable an alarm or trap. You might turn the spark- craft and electroplasmic devices around the city to your advantage. You could try to use your technical expertise to control a vehicle (but Finessing might be better).</em>",
      "Wreck": "When you <strong>Wreck</strong>, you unleash savage force. <em>You might smash down a door or wall with a sledgehammer, or use an explosive to do the same. You might employ chaos or sabotage to create a distraction or overcome an obstacle. You could try to overwhelm an enemy with sheer force in battle (but Skirmishing might be better).</em>"
